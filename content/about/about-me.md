I am a web and mobile application developer at HealthPartners with education in computer science. My expertise is in full stack development, which means working with Spring Boot microservices, JavaScript user interfaces, campaign HTML emails, and iOS/Android apps alike. I am motivated by constant learning and growth - if there’s a new way to do something tomorrow, I’d love to know about it and receive feedback on my own processes as soon as possible. I greatly value genuine connection and collaboration with my teammates and other partners, so I work hard to incorporate thoughtfulness and care into the regular work that I do.
