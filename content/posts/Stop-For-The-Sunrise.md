Sometimes I need to slow down and remind myself to appreciate the little things - like the sun rising/setting every single day. 

Over the last couple of weeks, I've been feeling a little down. Whether it's from the short winter days, stress about making big decisions, what's going on in the news, or just being exhausted from work, I feel like I don't spend always spend enough time appreciating the little things that make me smile. 

Today, I stopped by the icy Lake Superior shores of South Beach in Marquette and waited in the icy wind for the sun to greet me. I noticed where old footprints trailed down the beach, the light glinting off the shards of ice, the crow doing its morning rounds over the lake, and the chill on my (perpetually cold) hands. 

Around 8:20AM, the sun peeked over the grey winter clouds and cast its golden light over the beach. It disappeared a few minutes later behind the same grey winter clouds, but the light of the new day had arrived.

Every day the sun rises, and it sets. Whether it's cloudy or clear, windy or calm, raining or snowing, the sun will spend some time hanging over our hemisphere of the Earth. To me, there's something grounding about that consistency.

This morning is my reminder to be deliberate about appreciating the "sunrises" in my life. Whether it's an actual sunrise, quality time with friends & family, or a cool rock I found, these are the things that make life worth living. 

Be sturdy and have hope! â˜€
