## Overview

For a while now, I've been wanting an online portfolio, a place where I can share my thoughts, and a sandbox that I can experiment with. The one catch - I need it to be easy to quickly add new content. I tried building a React portfolio app in the past, but I quickly got bored of it because of how hard it is to quickly add new content that looks good.

The solution? A static site generator. After looking at a variety of options, I decided to try Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator built with Golang. This is the perfect solution because I could spend some time designing and styling the template custom to fit my needs, learn along the way, and adding new content is as simple as creating a new Markdown file.

This website is the result! 

See [my blog post]({{< ref "posts/creating-hugo-blog" >}}) for more information about the process behind making it and technical details about how Hugo works.
