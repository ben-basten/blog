## Overview

One of my absolute favorite courses at NMU was "Client-Side Programming". This purpose of this class was to introduce a variety of topics in modern web development, including JavaScript best practices, websockets, Vue.js, and creating basic web servers with Express.

For the final project of this class, we were tasked with creating a web app of our choosing. Partnering up with my friend Sam, we chose to create a Scrabble knockoff game.
