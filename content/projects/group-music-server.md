## Overview

One of the degree requirements for Computer Science majors at NMU was to do a capstone "Senior Project". It was up to me to come up with an idea, write out the project requirements for grading, and develop the app.

After spending Spring 2020 quarantining with my family and spending countless hours on the phone with my friends playing [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) (online pictionary) and watching Netflix over Skype calls, I knew that I wanted to create a tool that could bring people together from afar. Hence the idea for the Group Music Server (AKA "Listening Party") was created.

The idea? Using my library of MP3 music, create an app where clients can join private listening rooms and simultaneously listen to the same music queue as everyone else in the room.
